Sittin' here, thousand miles from nowhere
In this one room country little shack
Sittin' here, thousand miles from nowhere
In this one room country little shack
My only worldly possession is a ragged ol' 'leven foot cotton sack

I wake up every night 'bout midnight
People, I just can't sleep no more
I wake up every night 'bout midnight
People, I just can't sleep no more
Only crickets and frogs to keep me company
And the wind howlin' 'round my door

I'm gonna leave here early in the mornin'
I'm 'bout to go out of my mind
I'm gonna leave here early in the mornin'
I'm 'bout to go out of my mind
I'm gonna find me some kind of a companion
Even if she's dumb, deaf, cripple and blind

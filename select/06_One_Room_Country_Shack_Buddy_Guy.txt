Sittin' here a thousand miles from nowhere
People, I'm in my one room country little shack
I'm sittin' here a thousand miles from nowhere
People, I'm in my own, own one room country little shack

All my worries and companion
Is an old, is an old 'leven foot cotton sack

I'm wanna leave, oh early in the mornin'
People, because I'm 'bout to go out on my mind
I'm gonna leave you early in the mornin'
People, because, just because I'm 'bout to go out on my mind

I'm gonna find me some kind of good woman
Even if she's dumb, deaf, crippled or blind

Play your piano

Lord, you make me feel so good this morning, do it again
Have mercy, have mercy on me, have mercy on me
Alright!
Yes, yes, yes
Oh, lord, have mercy

You don't know
You don't know how, how I feel
Lord have mercy down in this cotton field

You don' know
People, people, you don't know how I feel
Have mercy in this cotton field

I know you're out there havin' a good time
Why don't you, why don't you make connection with me and give me some good deal?

Let me have a little bit of Otis Spann, please

So many ways
So many ways you can get the blues
So many ways
So, so many ways you can get the blues

Yes, when you're down here on one of these cottonfields
Lord, you ain't got nothing to lose
